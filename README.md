## ✨ Overview
**SketchDB** is an open-source tool that empowers developers, architects, and teams to **design database schemas visually** and instantly **export production-ready model files**.  

Unlike traditional ERD/diagramming tools, SketchDB goes beyond visualization — it bridges the gap between **schema design** and **framework-ready code generation**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎨 **Visual Database Design** – create tables, fields, and relationships easily.  
- ⚡ **One-Click Export** – generate ORM models directly.  
- 🛠️ **Framework-Specific Support (out of the box)**  
  - Django (Python ORM models)  
  - FastAPI / SQLAlchemy  
  - Odoo ORM  
  - …more coming soon (NestJS, Laravel, Rails).  
- 🔒 **Accuracy & Consistency** – no manual errors when converting diagrams to code.  
- 🌍 **Open & Extensible** – add custom exporters for any framework.

## 💡 Why SketchDB? (USP)
Most tools stop at diagramming. **SketchDB is different.**  
It not only helps you **design schemas visually**, but also:  

1. **Generates framework-ready code** (models, migrations, relationships).  
2. **Saves development time** by removing boilerplate.  
3. **Keeps your schema and models in sync.**  
4. **Accelerates onboarding** for teams working across multiple frameworks.  

👉 *Design once, generate everywhere.*
